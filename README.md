### What is this?
A simple web app that shows **real-time bus arrivals** at three key stops in South Horizons:
- **西邨站** 
- **海韻閣** 
- **大公園** 

Tracks buses: **595, 592, 99, 90B, 95C**

### Why did I build this?
Every morning is chaos. Kids screaming, bags forgotten, shoes missing. The last thing you need is standing at the bus stop wondering "when's the next bus?!"

This app shows you:
-  **Exact arrival time** 
-  **Minutes until arrival**
-  **Visual bar** (the longer, the longer you wait)
-  **Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds**

Check it before leaving home. Pick the right stop. Save 5-10 minutes. Get coffee instead.

### How to use?
1. Open the website on your phone
2. Tap on your nearest bus stop (西邨站 / 海韻閣 / 大公園)
3. See which bus arrives first
4. Run!
